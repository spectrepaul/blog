## _ZX Spectrum Next - Using Tiled_<br>
Here you will find everything you need to export your game maps directly from within Tiled, in the Speccy Next format. No other tools or conversion required.<br>
You will find it covers most options for Layer 2 and Layer 3. Also covers settings for priority bits with rotate, flip and above/below the ULA.

## _ZX Spectrum Next - Using Aseprite_<br>
Again made for ease of use. This time use Aseprite to directly import/export, sprites, tiles, palettes and images. Again full support of priority bit, for example with palettes to force all pixels set with this to be drawn above all other layers. Image export can auto rotate or flip for correct loading on the Next. Convert your palette to best suite the available colours on the Next and create blank spritesheets with the default Next palettes with 256 or 512 colours. Also experiment with 12bit colour for 4096 KS3 options.

I hope you enjoy the posts and find these materials useful, but make sure you check back in for other additions!<br><br>
