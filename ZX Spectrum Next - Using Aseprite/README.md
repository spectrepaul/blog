# Aseprite scripts for the ZX Spectrum Next

I have created a series of scripts to be placed in the default Aseprite script folder.<br>

You can find this by opening Aseprite and in the menu selecting:<br>
    - File<br>
    -- Scripts<br>
    --- Open scripts folder<br>

The first is a simple blank image creator.<br>

File name -- SpectrumNext_SpriteSheet_CreateBlank.lua<br>

With this you can select a sprite size of 8 or 16, size in X and Y and how many colours, 16, 256 or 512.<br>
Once you press create it will then make the correct image with a palette of:<br>

16  - Standard Spectrum<br>
256 - Spectrum Next RRRGGGBB<br>
512 - Spectrum Next RRRGGGBBB<br>

There will be more useful ones to follow so make sure you call back.<br>
Have fun and I hope you enjoy the posts and find these materials useful!<br>
